In this project I tried to do and app that takes api request thruw unsplash API .I used axios library in order to 
fetch data from unsplash. The most challenging thing in the app is the reverse connection between parent and child.I
tried to sen information from child to parent by event handlers. Event handler checks onchange on input and takes that value to update state and then i pass the state to the input as a prop.
